# Nivara

v1.0.20

Meet Nivara, Vitality's mentally unstable counterpart. An ongoing lab experiment. This is for the testing branch of Vitality, led by the Nivara Research & Development group. Any features and fixes implemented in Nivara will not appear in Vitality until we know they're all pretty enough.
