# Nivara

Semantic Versioning (for those who care) will start initially at v1.0.5 (according to Vitality's latest release) and build up over time. Expected to be volatile and is guaranteed to not stay at a certain number.

Meet Nivara, Vitality's mentally unstable counterpart. An ongoing lab experiment. This is for the testing branch of Vitality, led by the Nivara Research & Development group. Any features and fixes implemented in Nivara will not appear in Vitality until we know they're all pretty enough.
